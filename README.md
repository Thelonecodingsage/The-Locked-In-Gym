Future UI Enhancements:

While the primary focus of this project was on secure backend architecture and database integrity (PHP/PDO), the following aesthetic and functional improvements are planned for the user interface:
    - Modernization: Integrate a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to improve responsiveness and visual appeal.
    - Form Validation: Implement client-side JavaScript validation for all forms (registration, login) to provide immediate feedback to the user and improve the overall user experience.

Future Backend and Database Enhancements

  - Search/Filtering:Add functionality to allow Admins to easily search and filter the member list based on various criteria (e.g., membership expiry date).
  - Reporting: Introduce complex SQL queries to generate simple reports (e.g., number of active members, new members this month).
